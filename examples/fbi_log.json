The information recovered from or transmitted by a skimming device could then be used alone or in conjunction with another access device to incur charges or withdraw funds from a victim’s account without the victim’s consent, knowledge, or authorization.  During the course of the scheme, it is alleged that Purgariu and the other subjects requested disbursements totaling more than $220,000 in EBT funds from more than 300 victims' accounts. </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>On April 19, 2023, a federal arrest warrant was issued for Bogdan Adrian Purgariu in the United States District Court, Central District of California, Santa Ana, California, after he was charged with bank fraud and aggravated identity theft.</p>",
